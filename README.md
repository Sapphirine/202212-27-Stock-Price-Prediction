# Stock Price Prediction with Media Sentiment
## Abstract:
 Stock prediction has been one of the most popular topic in the field of data analysis. It is known to all that public sentiment toward the market has a strong correlation with the stock price. In this paper, we will implement sentiment analysis on the twitter data and utilize some machine learning algorithms to predict the stock price basing on the analysis result of twitter data. After that we will implement a decent web application to display the prediction result.
